# Multi-Agentic Recommender Systems

### Foundations, Design Patterns, and E-Commerce Applications (Industrial Tutorial)

Welcome! This website hosts the materials for the industrial tutorial **“Multi-Agentic Recommender Systems: Foundations, Design Patterns, and E-Commerce Applications.”** The tutorial shares a practical, industry-informed perspective on **LLM-powered agentic and multi-agent frameworks for recommender systems**, with an emphasis on real-world design patterns, orchestration workflows, and deployment considerations.

## About the tutorial

Modern recommender systems have made major progress, but many large-scale, user-facing solutions still behave like **static “one-shot” recommenders**. As user expectations shift toward **interactive, context-aware, and adaptive experiences**, recommender systems increasingly need to support **multi-step reasoning**, **tool use**, **memory**, and **autonomous orchestration**.

This tutorial focuses on how recent advances in **large language models (LLMs)** enable a new class of recommender systems: **agentic** (and often **multi-agent**) systems that can:

* reason over evolving user needs,
* interact through dialog and longer context,
* call tools and external APIs,
* orchestrate multi-step workflows,
* refine outputs using constraints and feedback,
* and support practical production requirements (reliability, scalability, transparency, safety).

Examples and patterns discussed include **context-aware recommendation**, **dynamic multi-step orchestration**, and **personalized recommendation pipelines**, culminating in a hands-on session that bridges concepts with implementation.
